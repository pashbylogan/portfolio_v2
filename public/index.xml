      <description>The simpler the better In software engineering it&amp;rsquo;s a well known principle that the simplest solution is the best. That way, others will be able to understand the solution quickly, and it will be easier to maintain in the future. Even when choosing between simplicity and optimization, simplicity should usually win.
It turns out that keeping this in mind, no matter the task, puts your brain in a state that&amp;rsquo;s ready to tackle issues in a better way.</description>

      <description>As remote learning continues to be the norm, teachers and professors are relying more heavily on recorded lectures to deliver course material to their students. However, recorded lectures can be time-consuming to edit, and cleaning up audio files can be a particular challenge.
That&amp;rsquo;s where Autocut comes in. Autocut is an open-source tool designed to automatically clean up recorded lectures, saving teachers and professors valuable time and effort. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to allow a user to upload their lecture video into the tool and Autocut will proceed to edit out silence, dead air, and noise artifacts from audio files and their accompanying video (if applicable).</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss our award-winning hackathon project from the 2021 Western Washington University Hackathon. Our team developed a web application called Fictionary that generates fictitious definitions for coherent words. We&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through the process of building this app, which consists of a large language model, a website, and an API that passes information between the two. We&amp;rsquo;ll also share code examples, images, and insights into our project&amp;rsquo;s development.</description>
