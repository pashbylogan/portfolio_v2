### The simpler the better

In software engineering it's a well known principle that the simplest solution is the best. That way, others will be able to understand the solution quickly, and it will be easier to maintain in the future. Even when choosing between simplicity and optimization, simplicity should usually win.

It turns out that keeping this in mind, no matter the task, puts your brain in a state that's ready to tackle issues in a better way. Start with "this is simple" will force you to start from the best potential solutions.
