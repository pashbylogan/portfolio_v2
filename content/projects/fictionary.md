## Introduction

In this blog post, I'll discuss our award-winning hackathon project from the 2021 Western Washington University Hackathon. Our team developed a web application called Fictionary that generates fictitious definitions for coherent words. We'll guide you through the process of building this app, which consists of a large language model, a website, and an API that passes information between the two. We'll also share code examples, images, and insights into our project's development.

## **Language Model: Fine-Tuning GPT-2**

To create Fictionary, we fine-tuned the GPT-2 language model (which we got from [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) ðŸ¤—) on dictionary data to train it to generate new definitions for given words. We compared the results between fine-tuning on Urban Dictionary and the Online Plain Text English Dictionary. Ultimately, we decided to go with Urban Dictionary as the dataset was significantly larger and provided more entertaining definitions.

### **Data Cleaning and Profanity Check**

To get the data into a usable format, we downloaded all of Urban Dictionary to a CSV and used pandas to remove duplicates, extremely vulgar definitions, etc. We applied a profanity check in two places to the data to make the definitions generated from Urban Dictionary less vulgar. The aforementioned data-cleaning phase as well as in the API itself to check the actual generated text. This pared the dataset down to around 2 million word-definition pairs. Here's a snippet of our profanity check code:

```python
try:
    definition = models.define(model, word, num_return=1)[0]
    definition = definition
                    .replace(']', '')
                    .replace('[', '')\
                    .replace('f***', 'duck')
                    .replace('c***', 'trunk')\
                    .replace('sex', 'love')
    if definition[-1] != '.':
        definition += '.'
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    definition = "This word is undefinable. Good job..."
```

*Please note that the model still may generate explicit material occasionally, so use it at your own discretion.*

## **Building the Website**

We built the website using Node.js and Express for the webserver backend, Handlebars for HTML templating, and Sass for styling. Below is a simplified example of our server setup:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst express = require('express');
const app = express();
var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');

app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.use('/', indexRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Fictionary app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

### **Twitter and Zazzle API Integration**

We also integrated the Twitter API for users to tweet about their Fictionary words and the Zazzle API to create a custom mug featuring their words and definition.

## **Creating the API with Flask**

Lastly, we developed an API using the Flask Python framework to communicate between the language model and the website. Here's a basic example of our Flask API setup:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import sys

sys.path.append('..')
import models.train as models

app = Flask(__name__)

# ML model definition
loaded_models = {
    '1': 'data/dict-short.bin',
    '2': 'data/dict-long.bin',
    '3': 'data/urbandict.bin',
    '4': 'data/urbandict-long.bin',
}
model = input(f"{loaded_models}\nEnter model number from above: ")
weights = loaded_models[model]
model = models.get_model_for_api(weights_path=weights)

@app.route('/word', methods=["POST"])
def word():
    data = request.json
    word = data['word']
    definition = models.define(model, word, num_return=1)[0]

    resp_data = json.dumps(
            {'definition': definition}
        )
    response = Response(resp_data)
    return response

@app.route('/', methods=["GET"])
def index():
    return redirect(f'http://hackathon.chrisdaw.net:3030', 301)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    """
    # Load ML model
    for k, weights_path in loaded_models.items():
        loaded_models[k] = models.get_model(weights_path)
    """
    app.debug=True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')  # run our Flask app
```

## **Fictionary Now Available in React**

Since its release, I have [forked the repo](https://github.com/pashbylogan/Fictionary) and made various improvements including:

1. Ported the app over to React
    
2. Set up permanent hosting on my website for everyone to enjoy
    
3. Added additional security to the Flask API like authentication
    

### **Call to Action: Try Fictionary Now!**

We invite you to visit [**loganpashby.com/fictionary**](http://loganpashby.com/fictionary) to try Fictionary for yourself. Generate your own unique and entertaining definitions for any words you can imagine and share them with your friends. You can also create a custom mug featuring your word and definition, or tweet your creations to your followers. Have fun, and remember to use Fictionary responsibly!
