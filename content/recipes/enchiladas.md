Just a little enchilada recipe.

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 green pepper, chopped
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes and green chiles
- 1/4 cup picante sauce
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 cups cooked brown rice
- 8 flour tortillas (6 inches), warmed
- 1 cup salsa
- 1 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- Optional toppings: Cotija cheese, red onion, jalapeno peppers, avocado, lime wedges

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add green pepper, onion, and garlic; cook until tender. Add ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink. Drain.
2. Stir in black beans, tomatoes, picante sauce, chili powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer. Add cooked rice; simmer for 5 minutes.
