- 2 large eggs , lightly beaten
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 zucchini , cut in half vertically, then sliced in half circles
- 8 ounces mushroom , chopped
- 3 cloves garlic , minced
- 2 TBS brown sugar

1. In a large stock pot, fill halfway with water, salt, and bring to a boil. Add linguine and cook according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl combine brown sugar, soy sauce, sriracha, and ginger; whisk well to combine; set aside.
