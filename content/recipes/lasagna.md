## Description
Dead simple lasagna (uncooked noodles).

## Ingredients
Meat Sauce:
- 1 pound lean ground beef
  - _(optional: Substitute italian sausage for some kick)_
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
- 1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

Cheese Filling:
- 1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese
- 1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Other:
- 1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
- 8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Make sauce: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and mushrooms; sauté until onions are transparent. Stir in pasta sauce and cook until heated through. Set aside.
3. Make filling: Combine cottage cheese, ricotta, eggs, and Parmesan in a medium bowl and set aside.
4. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 13x9-inch dish. Layer with uncooked lasagna noodles, cheese filling, mozzarella, and meat sauce. Continue layering until all components are used, reserving 1/2 cup mozzarella. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil and top with reserved 1/2 cup mozzarella. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 15 more minutes. Let lasagna stand for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
